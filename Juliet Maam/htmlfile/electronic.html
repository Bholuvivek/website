<ul><li>Carbon nanotubes are close to replacing silicon as a material for making smaller, faster and more 
efficient microchips and devices, as well as lighter, more conductive and stronger quantum 
nanowires. Graphene's properties make it an ideal candidate for the development of flexible 
touchscreens.Nanomaterials are functional materials that are created and utilized at nanoscale 
having one dimension and a size from 1 to 100 nm. These materials are considered the significant 
creation of nanotechnology. The green nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted considerable attention 
from researchers in the last three decades due to their uncommon properties and various 
applications in the field of electronics (gas sensor, capacitor, lithium-ion battery, and separator). 
These unique properties change continuously with a change in the size of nanomaterial.</li></ul></P></div>

<P><ul><li> A large 
number of reports exist on the research work carried out in synthesizing different types of 
nanomaterial by green methods. The synthesis of green nanoparticles requires plant extracts like 
flowers, shrubs, leaves, protein, and naturally occurring polymer as natural surfactants. The idea of 
using greener routes is to reduce the cost, use of toxic reagents, and risks in the lab along with 
minimizing the waste and power consumption. Nanomaterials include other electrical candidates 
such as nanowires, nanorods, nanofillers, nanocrystallites, and quantum dots. The formulation of 
diverse nanoparticles such as metal, bimetallic/trimetallic, metal oxide, metal chalcogenide, silic based, polymer-based nanoparticles, and hybrid nanomaterials via green source demonstrated 
excellent electronic/optoelectronic properties and various uses such as sensors, displays, medical 
diagnostics, transistors, fuel cells, battery manufacturing, etc. </li></ul></p>
<br><br>
<P><ul><li>
The size of green nanoparticles varies 
with the change in concentration of plant extract and the range of temperature employed. The plant 
extract plays the role of the reducing/capping agent during the synthesis of green nanomaterials. 
The methods used for the synthesis of green nanoparticles are the solgel technique, hydrothermal 
method, solvothermal strategy, and coprecipitation. Thus, this chapter covers the synthesis of 
nanomaterials via greener routes. It also includes the application of such nanomaterials in the 
electronics and electrical industries.
